# NLP_AMMI_Emotional_Scoring
## Overview
This repository focuses on the application of Data Science techniques for document analysis and understanding. The project including XML annotation, emotional scoring by Vector Space Model and LSTM methods.

1. **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**
   - Sequence labeling problem: Named entity, Brand word recognition, Part of speech tagging, Syntax analysis, New word discovery.
   - Classification problem: Emotion analysis, Category, Intention recognition.
   - Rewrite problem: Query extension, Rewrite, Error correction, Translation.
   - Generate problem: Automatic writing, Automatically write poetry, Text summary, Chat robot, Automatic question and answer, Voice synthesis.

2. **Tasks**
   - XML annotation using software like Notepad++.
   - Use the vector space model to represent text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers, such as, for example, index terms. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. 
   - Use the LSTM method to do the emotional matching analysis and training processing.
